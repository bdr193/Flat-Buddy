  :monthly_price: 780
  :description: "Really nice double bedroom, furnished in a quiet area about 5-10
    minutes walk from Elephant and Castle or 20 minutes walk from London Bridge. \nThe
    room is very quiet and peaceful - situated at the back of the house where there
    is no street noise. Through the window are pleasant views of trees and the room
    is and not overlooked by neighbouring windows. The room is sunny and bright most
    of the day. \nThere is sufficient space to do yoga so enough space for most things!
    There are drawers, a wardrobe and shelves but extra storage on the landing if
    required. There is also a desk in the bedroom.\nThe house has two bathrooms so
    you will only be sharing with one other person. \nTheres a flat roof which is
    so nice and hot when it is sunny and also a courtyard at the back where it is
    safe to store bikes etc. \nWe have a lovely big kitchen with 2 fridge freezers
    and plenty of storage space for kitchenware. There is also a dishwasher and washing
    machine.\nThere is also a nice shared living room. \nMy housemates are always
    very clean and tidy and really welcoming, they are all students at Kings College
    and enjoy things like food/cooking and playing netball. They study medicine/psychology,
    physiotherapy and pharmacy.\nThe house is only ten minutes walk from Burgess Park
    as well which is a lovely place to go for a walk and to watch the sunset. There
    is a little Tesco a couple of minutes walk away, Lidl and Sainsburys 5-10 minutes
    walk and then a large Tesco 15 minutes away.\nIt is perfect location for students
    at LSBU, UAL or Kings being only 15 minutes walk from their campuses, but still
    not far to travel otherwise as close to northern, bakerloo and jubilee lines aswell
    as 5 minute walk to the overground. Only half an hour on the bus to UCL.\nBills
    about £33 a month, wifi is very good.\nPlease note if you are not a student, council
    tax is not included in this figure for rent, I think it is about £90 a month,
    however living on the edge on zone 1 you save a lot on transport and can walk
    many places and all places will charge council tax of course)\n\n(This current
    tenancy is 8 months but there may a chance to renew for another year at the end
    of the contract with come of the other housemates)"

    Looking to rent out my attic room as im away in LA for work for quite a while. I am into sports, working out, music, good company.

    The other flatmates are into football, one is creating his own start up, one works in advertising and the other is a basketball coach.

    They are open minded and very relaxed. I guess the only non spoken rule is that we was our dishes after use. I think that helps keep the peace lol.

    from 11 November 0017 "
  :monthly_price: 1200
  :description: "Hi! We are seeking a person or couple to share our beautiful penthouse
    apartment on Holloway Road. The house is stunning. It is in a converted 19th century
    school with high ceilings and beautiful arched windows in each room. It includes
    two large bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open-plan kitchen and reception room, a
    study area and a large private terrace with views of the city on the roof. It
    also has a dishwasher and washing machine. It is 200m walk to Holloway station
    on the Piccadilly Line (two stops from Kings Cross) and 1km walk to Oxford Circus.
    \n\nWe are a young couple who enjoy having dinner, wine and chats. We are looking
    for someone (or a couple) who would be a chill and respectful flatmate and fun
    to live with. We both travel a lot for work as Yasamin (28) is a political consultant
    who works in the Middle East and James (32) is a university lecturer in Cornwall.
    We really enjoy good food, nice wine, walks in parks, dance music and nice conversation.
    Yasamin really likes relaxing and going for a walk to unwind. We are both very
    laid back and enjoy living in a reasonably tidy and clean space.\n\nIn terms of
    practical stuff, we have just signed a lease on the property and will be moving
    in on 11 November. We are looking for someone to move in pretty soon after that.
    We will have access to the house on 11 November so we can arrange for people to
    come see the house on the weekend of 11-12 November. You would have to fill in
    an application with the real estate agent and there would be a standard fee associated
    with that. Having said that, the house is very much as it appears in the photos
    (except it is furnished). Your bedroom is near identical to the one pictured except
    it doesn’t have a built-in-robe and your bathroom is across the hall rather than
    an ensuite. You can see this on the floor plan. The house is furnished but we
    could discuss if you had any furniture you wanted to bring in If you are interested
    please send us a message and tell us a little bit about yourself. We would like
    to live with someone that we click with and that will make the house a warm and
    pleasant place to live."

    I'm moving in with my boyfriend. You'd be sharing with 2 guys, who are pretty relaxed, in their early 30s, working in IT sales and vfx/advertising.

    The guys work hard during the week so are pretty chilled and relaxed, but wouldn’t mind the occasional cheeky drink/dinner now and again. They have their own lives but we all hang out often, so would suit someone like minded, but also has their own thing going on. Into all the normal usual stuff gigs/music, films, seeing things etc

  :description: "A good sized room in a modernised flat in an unbeatable location,
    available from 15 December.\r\n\n\r\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The MINIMUM rental period
    is six months, but we will only rent to people interested in staying for longer
    than that.\r\n\n\r\n\nOur flat is on a quiet street five minutes' walk from Tottenham
    Court Road and 15 minutes from Oxford Street, with shopping, restaurants and entertainment
    close by. Excellent transport links with five tube lines (Victoria/Northern/Met/Circle/H&C)
    five minutes' walk away via Warren Street and Great Portland Street stations.\r\n\nThe
    room is double sized and comes furnished with a double bed, built-in wardrobe,
    desk, bookcase and pedestal cabinet. It looks onto a sunny communal garden.\r\n\nOur
    flat has two toilets, a large kitchen and an outside balcony. There's no living
    room sadly.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe flat would suit a tidy and responsible mature/postgraduate
    student  or professional in their mid-20s to late 30s with previous experience
    of sharing a home with strangers. A female flatmate is moving out and we are looking
    to have a gender balance.\r\n\n\r\n\nWe are: one male journalist aged 33, one
    male civil servant aged 40, and one female hairdresser aged 28. We clean the flat
    ourselves, and you'll join in.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe total cost including bills is 769.10
    per month and six weeks' rent (990) is payable as a deposit. Please note, if you
    have not lived in the UK for at least 12 months before moving in, the deposit
    is three months' rent (2145) instead. There would be a rent-free period towards
    the end of the rental period to compensate for this (details can be discussed
    on visiting).\r\n\n\r\n\nReferences must be provided - and it would be great if
    you could start to request them before you visit. No couples please."

    double room for rent in a big, bright house in Elephant & Castle/Walworth area,
    3 minute walk to Elephant & Castle tube/overground station. The house is set away
    from the main road so there is little traffic noise. \r\n\n\r\n\nThe house has
    4 double bedrooms, all with loads of storage space in built-in wardrobes. There
    are 2 bathrooms and a WC (no queues), a kitchen and a huge living room/dining
    area, and a back garden with table and chairs. \r\n\n\r\n\nWe have nice, friendly
    neighbours who are very settled, and there are lots of shops etc nearby on Walworth

    and the 56a Bike Space located in front of the property if you want to get involved
    in the local community.\r\n\n\r\n\nLooking for *clean and tidy* non-smokers only,
    who are used to communal living and sharing space in a mindful and considerate
    way. We are graduate medical student and MSc students, and also work part-time,
    so it's essential that people are very clean, tidy and considerate of others in
    how they share space, proactive about the cleaning and about looking after the
    house, and respect other housemates in terms of noise etc. We're looking to keep
    a very low-key, peaceful, quiet and relaxed vibe at home, so no parties. We're
    LGBT-friendly.\r\n\n\r\n\nIt's a 9 month contract, until August 2018. Bills are
    about 40 a month, council tax about another 25 (though postgraduate students also
    welcome, so we can claim a council tax exemption)."

    from 2 December 2017 "
  :monthly_price: 1015
  :description: "A huge, beautiful double room on the top floor of a 3 story house.
    Sharing with two lovely females near Columbia Rd flower market and Shoreditch.
    Will be living with Julia (25, Finland) and Sian (28, Australia).\r\n\n\r\n\nThe
    house vibe is very relaxed and friendly. Everyone enjoys spending time together
    but also having their own space. The house is plenty big for that with a huge
    living room on the second floor and back garden. Sian works in marketing and Julia
    is a designer. We enjoy going to art galleries, yoga, live music and the odd glass
    red wine and chat.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe room is huge, with big double door inbuilt cupboard.
    Comes furnished with bed, desk and 2 sets of draws as in photos. Gets all the
    morning sun and light and overlooks a quiet back leafy back area :)\r\n\n\r\n\nThe
    house has everything needed in the kitchen for cooking with big glass doors to
    our backyard. \r\n\nAlso fast internet, bike storage under the stairs and a big
    storage cupboard.  \r\n\n\r\n\nCouple probably preferred but the right single
    person would be considered (but rent would be the same). Bills are approx 80/month
    per person. \r\n\n\r\n\n5 minute walk to Shoreditch High Street, Hoxton Overground,
    Columbia Road flower market. Old street tube, Broadway market and London fields
    a short walk or quick bus.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe room is available as of 2Dec (is a Saturday
    for easy move in) but is flexible from now until early December if it helps! The
    usual tenancy changeover fees and security deposit will be required from the rental
    agency.\r\n\n\r\n\nLooking to have house viewings later this week so please send
    us an email with a brief description of yourself and we can arrange a time to
    visit and meet everyone.  \r\n\n\r\n\nThanks!"

  :monthly_price: 1050
  :description: "The master bedroom with its own ensuite bathroom is available in
    this lovely and homely house in Wapping. It occupies the entire top floor, so
    feels like a private studio.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe house has a smart modern kitchen and
    a good size separate lounge with dining table. There is plenty of space; the house
    is set over 3 storeys, and there is a third bedroom which is not rented out but
    used as a shared study / storage room.\r\n\n\r\n\nThere is a nice garden with
    room to sit out in decent weather, and there is secure parking.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe
    house is opposite Tobacco Dock, off Wapping Lane. The setting is very quiet as
    the house is on a private development off the road, and the front looks out onto
    an ornamental canal.\r\n\n\r\n\nThere are great transport links to the City or
    Canary Wharf, being 5 minutes walk from Wapping Overground and 10 minutes walk
    from Shadwell Overground and DLR. The house is a 10 minute walk from Waitrose
    and St Katherine Docks, and 5 minutes to the pubs and restaurants of Wapping.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe
    rent includes council tax and water bills. Broadband and gas / electricity are
    approximately another 50 per month. The house is rented privately, so there is
    no additional agency fee.\r\n\n\r\n\nI am looking for someone who is a non-smoker,
    tidy and considerate to share the house with, but friendly and up for a chat over
    a glass of wine or a cup of tea as well. I work quite hard and enjoy a relaxed,
    calm, homely atmosphere; someone similar, looking for a nice, grown-up home, would
    be ideal. Please get in touch if you would like to view the room and house."

  :monthly_price: 475
  :description: "Hello lovely females, \r\n\n\r\n\nI will be moving out out of the
    lovely Battersea flatshare and my 3 flatmates would like somebody easy going and
    friendly as they are themselves. Viktoria is Hungarian, Sandy is German and Penelope
    Irish, two are full time working in fashion and one studies Interior Design. Interests
    are in design, art, fashion,fitness, cooking, baking and all things craft. They
    are very friendly but also quite busy. There is one bathroom and shower but this
    has Never been an issue with morning run to work as times are different for all
    of us as well as one of the flatmates is most of the time at her boyfriend's so
    it feels like living with 2 others, not 3. \r\n\nThe room is small but cosy with
    a single bed and a built in wardrobe with lots of storage space in the outside
    hall cupboard. The light is fantastic in the morning and the tree in the spring
    outside the window has been the prettiest feature for me!  \r\n\nThe living room
    is really big and comfortable, leading onto the garden outside with a shed. \r\n\nFlat
    is really quiet, in a quiet estate area minutes from Battersea bridge and Battersea
    park which is stunning. There is a supermarket very near and a few others near
    by. \r\n\nI don't need to tell you how lovely is to walk by the river and you
    can continue following it all the way to Embankment and beyond, but i just did.
    \r\n\nBills come up to around 60 each.\r\n\nPlease get in touch and tell us something
    about yourself. :)"

    6 January 2018 "
  :monthly_price: 750
  :description: "Hi there\r\n\n\r\n\nWe are a small family looking for a long-term
    lodger, who is employed full-time, is well-mannered, considerate, quiet, tidy
    and, most importantly kid-friendly.  Ideally suit someone interested in music,
    books and food!\r\n\n\r\n\nWe have a lovely newly extended 5 bedroom house in
    Clapham, Zone 2, in a quiet, family road, 2mins from the Common, and in between
    Clapham Common tube and Clapham Junction overground.  We are really well linked
    to buses (87,77,452,345) - you can be in central london in 40 mins door to door.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe
    room we are renting out is a new double with a beautiful new kingsize bed, mattress
    and bedding, bedside table, lamp, and a chest of 6 drawers.  Right outside the
    room is a shower room with WC.  It's at the top of the house in the newly extended
    bit and is quiet and private away from the main house activities, but you would
    also have use of the double living room, and large eat-in kitchen.\r\n\n\r\n\nOur
    son is 9 years old and lives with us for parts of the week, and our daughter is
    7 and lives with us most weekends. One weekend every 4 weeks or so, we are kid
    free. As a couple we cook most nights, and you'd be welcome to join us or completely
    come and go as your please, it's up to you.  We do the usual stuff, watch TV,
    (try) to go to bed early in the week and go out Wed/Thursdays/have a few glasses
    of wine later in the week. The kids are polite and well behaved who have never
    bothered our previous lodgers, and they will be mostly out of your way.\r\n\n\r\n\nYou'd
    be welcome to have a guest and/or partner over, but because we have children,
    it wouldn't probably be suitable for us if you wanted to party all night at weekends
    and have loads of mates over (sorry, we miss those days!)\r\n\n\r\n\nThroughout
    the house is all wood floors, neutral decoration and is set over three-four levels.
    \ There is a small patio and garden too.\r\n\n\r\n\nWe would love to hear from
    any potential housemates, deposit of 6 weeks is required and 2 references please.\r\n\n\r\n\nRoom
    could be available earlier, depending on your needs and mutual convenience.\r\n\n\r\n\nThanks!

  :description: "Hello hello,\r\n\n\r\n\nWhat I've got here is a square, white room
    with \r\n\n- a big bed \r\n\n- a big window\r\n\n- a big emphasis on exposed brick\r\n\n-
    a big desk\r\n\n- and a big space heater\r\n\n\r\n\nThere is practically nothing
    not big about this room except for the actual size of the room (which is modest).
    Shouldn't pose a problem for millennial, nomadic, cyberpunk minimalists though
    -- and if that doesn't sound like you then it will in like 8 months. \r\n\n\r\n\nIn

    of the furniture came with the room (bed + custom bedstand, desk, chair, side
    tables, space heater), and you're welcome to keep it or throw everything away
    if you prefer an aesthetic other than \"everything is white\". Note that the desk
    lamp is pretty much the only piece of furniture I own and I'm taking it with me.

  :description: "Hello hello,\r\n\n\r\n\nWhat I've got here is a square, white room
    with \r\n\n- a big bed \r\n\n- a big window\r\n\n- a big emphasis on exposed brick\r\n\n-
    a big desk\r\n\n- and a big space heater\r\n\n\r\n\nThere is practically nothing
    not big about this room except for the actual size of the room (which is modest).
    Shouldn't pose a problem for millennial, nomadic, cyberpunk minimalists though
    -- and if that doesn't sound like you then it will in like 8 months. \r\n\n\r\n\nIn
    all seriousness though, I've been here for a couple years and I like it. \r\n\n\r\n\nMost
    of the furniture came with the room (bed + custom bedstand, desk, chair, side
    tables, space heater), and you're welcome to keep it or throw everything away
    if you prefer an aesthetic other than \"everything is white\". Note that the desk
    lamp is pretty much the only piece of furniture I own and I'm taking it with me.
